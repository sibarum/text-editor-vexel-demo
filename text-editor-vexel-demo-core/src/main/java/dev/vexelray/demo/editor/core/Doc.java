/**
 * The shape of the session, in one immutable value: which files are open, in what order, which one is in front,
 * which have unsaved work, and which folder the navigator shows.
 *
 * <h2>Whose it is</h2>
 *
 * <p>The {@link Editor}'s, and nobody else's. It is part of the editor's {@code State}, which only the editor's
 * declared steps change, and the view hears about a change as a message rather than by reading this. So it needs no
 * lock: a step runs on the editor's lane, one at a time, and returns the next value rather than changing this one.
 * What the session is goes here; what the editor is in the middle of (a question, a save, a restore) goes in the
 * {@code State}.
 *
 * <h2>What it does not hold is the text</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each document's text is already one versioned value, the {@code State<Document>} inside its {@code TextField} in
 * the view, so copying it here would be a second place it lives, and the two would disagree every keystroke. What is
 * here is the part nothing else owns: the shape of the session.
 *
 * <p>A tab is named by an {@code id}, not an index. An index is a fact about the tab bar at one instant, and a close
 * landing between a read and a write turns it into the neighbour's.

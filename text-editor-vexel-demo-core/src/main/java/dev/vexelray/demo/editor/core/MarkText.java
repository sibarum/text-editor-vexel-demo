 * A Markdown document's colours, worked out on the offload lane: {@link Markdown#spans} over the text it was sent.
 *
 * <p>A job because it is work over the whole document after every edit, and the view's time is the frame's. The reply
 * names the version of the text it was computed from, and the view applies it only if the field still says that, so a
 * slow answer about old text is dropped rather than drawn over new text.

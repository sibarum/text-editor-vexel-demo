/**
 * The controller: every decision the editor makes, as declared steps on one state, reached only by messages.
 *
 * <h2>A state, and the steps that change it</h2>
 *
 * <p>Everything the editor knows is one immutable value, a {@link State}, held by a {@link Ledger}. Nothing changes it
 * but a step declared below, and a step is a static method of the shape {@code (state, message, out) → next state}:
 * it reads the state and the message, says what it sends through its {@link Out}, and returns what the state is now.
 * The ledger runs one step at a time on the editor's lane and commits what it returns, so no step sees another
 * half-done, nothing needs a lock, and a step that throws changes nothing and sends nothing. The processor reads each
 * step's body and refuses one that captures, waits or touches the disk (chains.md's rule 1, design F): a step sees its
 * state, its message and its {@code Out}, and that is all.
 *
 * <p>So the editor holds no maps of callbacks, no flags and no counters outside its state: a question waiting for an
 * answer, a set of saves waiting to land and the session being restored are all in the {@link State}, as values.
 *
 * <h2>What it hears</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each message the editor acts on runs one step ({@link Ledger.Builder#on}): what the view reports, and what the
 * jobs reply. The sender publishes a plain message and does not know which step runs; the list in the constructor is
 * the whole of what the editor hears, the way a component's {@code @Subscribe} methods are.
 *
 * <h2>Closing is a chain</h2>
 *
 * <p>Closing tabs and quitting ask the same question and wait on the same saves, so they are one {@link Chain} with two
 * ways in ({@link #closing}): its first step decides whether anything is unsaved, the next asks, the person's answer
 * picks a branch (save, discard, cancel), and the last closes the tabs or answers the close gate. Read top to bottom,
 * it is the whole of what a close does, with every step it takes named; each run has one id, which is the question's
 * number and what a trace groups its steps by. A step that waits (on the person, on the disk) holds the run and keeps
 * the {@link Chain.Resume} in the state; the answer resumes it. Nothing waits on a thread.
 *
 * <h2>Effects are jobs</h2>
 *
 * <p>The disk is the jobs' ({@link ReadFile}, {@link WriteFile}, {@link FindPath}, {@link CreateFile},
 * {@link ReadSession}, {@link WriteSession}): a step sends a request and a later step acts on the reply. A slow disk is
 * a slow answer, never a stalled lane. Jobs are not in order with each other, so the restored session asks for one
 * file at a time and asks for the next when the last is answered.
 *
 * <h2>Where it is built</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@code @Component} that takes an {@link Inbox} is given its own, on the framework's logic lane: that is where
 * its messages arrive and where its steps run, on one thread with every other such component and never two at once.
 * So it declares no {@code @Subscribe}: what it hears is the list above, declared again as {@code @Hears} for the
 * processor, which cannot read a constructor (the lane checks at startup that the two agree). {@link Core} lists it, so
 * {@code -gui}'s generated wiring builds it; {@code EditorTest} builds it on a tick of its own, which is the same
 * thing without a window.

/**
 * The palette, held to what a dark theme has to be true of.
 *
 * <p>Worth having from the first day rather than the day a colour goes wrong, because a palette is derived:
 * one anchor moved by a tenth changes every surface and every shade of text at once, and nothing on screen
 * says which change did it. These are the checks that would have caught it.
 *
 * <p>When this application gets a real design, the useful version of this test is the one that <b>pins the gap
 * between the design and the construction</b> -- assert each authored colour against what the palette derives,
 * with the difference written down. A gap that is measured is a known quantity; a gap that is absorbed is a
 * surprise waiting for a review.

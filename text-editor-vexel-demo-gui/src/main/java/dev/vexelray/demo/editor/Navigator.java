/**
 * The file navigator: a path bar over a tree of what is in one folder. The {@link View}'s, on the GUI thread.
 *
 * <h2>The path bar is the whole of "open"</h2>
 *
 * <p>There is no file dialog, by choice, though the framework offers native ones ({@code Dialogs}). The bar
 * stands in for all three of them: type a folder and the tree shows it, type a file and it opens, type a name that
 * is not there yet and it is created. Ctrl+L puts the keyboard in it; Enter goes. It is an ordinary single-line
 * {@link TextField}, named {@code path}, and its {@code SUBMITTED} message is the whole of its wiring.
 *
 * <p>So it is where new things are named, too. A row's "New file here…" puts the folder into the bar with the caret
 * after it, and Enter makes the name typed there, from the template its extension asks for. A name ending in a
 * separator is a folder, and "New folder here…" adds that separator itself, so the person types only the name.
 *
 * <h2>The tree asks, and is answered</h2>
 *
 * <p>The tree asks for a level the first time it is opened ({@code TreeView.CHILDREN_WANTED}); reading a folder is
 * I/O, so the view asks {@code ListFolder} on the offload lane, and when the answer comes this turns it into the tree's
 * entries ({@link #children}). What a row is drawn from comes with the answer, so drawing calls nothing, and whether a
 * row is a folder is known from the listing that drew it, never by looking at the disk again on the GUI thread.
 *
 * <p>Selecting a file opens it: a click, or walking the tree with the arrow keys, which keeps the keyboard in the tree
 * so the walk carries on. Enter opens a folder in place. Rows move rather than jump when a folder opens, because the
 * tree is handed {@link Motion#arrival}. There is one tree for the life of the window, and showing another folder
 * refreshes it, which asks again for every level it has listed.

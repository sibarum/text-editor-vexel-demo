/**
 * What this module builds — one recipe per part — and nothing about when.
 *
 * <h2>The wiring is generated from this</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code TextEditorAppWiring} is written by {@code vexelray-framework-processor} while this module compiles, and
 * lands in {@code target/generated-sources/annotations}. It calls each method below once, in the phase its
 * parameters put it in: <b>a part's phase is the latest phase of anything it takes.</b> So the look exists before
 * the {@code Gui} does, and the window's contents wait for the {@code Gui}, its clock and its title bar. There is no
 * phase to declare and none to get wrong. Open the generated file after a build to see the order. Nothing here waits
 * for the window itself: what happens once it exists (the editor bringing back the last session) is heard as the
 * framework's {@code WindowOpened}, and no part takes the {@code Shell}, which the processor refuses.
 *
 * <h2>Where the rest comes from</h2>
 *
 * <p>Not every part is a recipe. The {@link View} is a {@code @Component}: a lane of its own, built from its one
 * constructor, reached by messages. The editor and the jobs that touch the disk are in {@code -core}, and reach the
 * wiring through {@code Core}, which {@code TextEditorApp} names among its starters beside {@code AutomationStarter},
 * the automation sockets.
 *
 * <p>Opening an input backend, installing a clipboard, remembering where the window was, attaching a clock, wiring
 * the frame loop with its wakes and its pacing, parsing the command line, installing the dialogs, and closing
 * everything in the right order are all {@code vexelray-framework}'s. So is closing the parts that are
 * {@code AutoCloseable}.
 *
 * <p>Adding a part is a method here. It returns an interface when other code should be able to swap it; this
 * package's own classes may be returned as they are, because nothing outside the package could hold a call site
 * against them anyway.

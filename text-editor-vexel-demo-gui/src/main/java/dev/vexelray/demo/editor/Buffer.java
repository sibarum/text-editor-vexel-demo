/**
 * One open file: its {@link TextField}, its colours, and what a save needs to know. The {@link View}'s, on the GUI
 * thread, so it holds plain fields and no locks.
 *
 * <p>The text is the field's own. Whether it is saved is the field's undo history's answer ({@code History.mark()}
 * and {@code clean()}): the history already knows which state was last saved, so this keeps no flag of its own for
 * that beyond the one case the history cannot express, a save that did not land.
 *
 * <h2>It hears its field, through the view</h2>
 *
 * <p>The field says what it did on its own topics, addressed by its name ({@code TextField.CHANGED},
 * {@code TextField.CARET}), and the view hands each to the buffer it is about. Nothing calls back into this: it is
 * told, and it answers with what to send, so the view does the sending.
 *
 * <h2>Colours, off the GUI thread</h2>
 *
 * <p>A Markdown file gets {@link Markdown#spans} after every edit. That is a pass over the whole text, so it is a job
 * ({@code MarkText}): {@link #changed} says what to ask it, and {@link #marked} applies the answer only if the field
 * still says the text it was computed for, because colours worked out for one text and attached to another are on the
 * wrong characters.

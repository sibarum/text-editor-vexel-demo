/**
 * The application's one tempo, on the framework's clock.
 *
 * <h2>What the window does already, and what is handed over here</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every window the framework builds already fades its colours, slides a node that layout moved, and fades a node
 * up as it is added and down before it is removed (the framework's {@code WindowMotion}). Nothing here has to ask for
 * that. What it asks of this code is to keep the nodes and change them: a list rebuilt from new nodes is every row
 * leaving and every row arriving, so use {@code Node.keyed} for anything drawn from a list.
 *
 * <p>A widget's own motion is different: it animates only when it is handed a {@link Timing} ({@code Tabs.slide},
 * {@code TreeView.motion}, {@code Cues}), and without one it cuts. A timing is a tempo, stated as data; the window's
 * clock runs it, so the tempi are said here, in one place.
 *
 * <p>Two durations, and they differ on purpose. A change — a tab arriving, a folder opening — should be over before
 * Ctrl+Tab held down could want the next one. A cue has to be <em>noticed</em>, and once its attack and release
 * are taken out a cue as short as a change has too little visible motion left.
 *
 * <p>{@code settle} on the automation socket waits these out, so a script's photograph is of the window at rest.

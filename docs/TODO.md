# TODO

Work on **VexelRay IDE** that is known about and not done. Distinct from
[framework-notes.md](framework-notes.md), which is about the framework rather than about this application —
if the fix belongs upstream, it goes there instead.

Keep an entry short enough that it does not need editing, and delete it when it is done rather than ticking it.

## Next

The 0.1 editor is being rebuilt on the v0.2 template, one milestone at a time: highlighting (done); editing details
(whitespace dots, Find and the formatted Markdown view done; word wrap with preferences; the plain window); the navigator's Add
menu, Open mode and folder pictures; scratches; preferences; running things and the console; Git mode; go to
declaration. Its code is on `develop`, to copy from as each piece is rebuilt.

- [ ] A native build with highlighting. TM4E reads its grammars by reflection: the 0.1 editor's metadata registered
      the `org.eclipse.tm4e.core.internal.grammar.raw.Raw*` classes, `grammars/*.json` and jcodings' `tables/*.bin`.
- [ ] Replace the palette anchors in `Look.java` with the design's, measured in Oklab. See the note in that file
      about which authored colours the construction can reproduce and which have to be declared.

## Later

- [ ] Automation coverage: `--automation=0` (or `-Dautomation=0`) opens a driving socket on a free port and prints it, and the landmarks in `Landmarks.java` are
      already the names a script would use. One scripted run through the main path is worth more than several
      unit tests of the view.

/**
 * The palette, as anchors.
 *
 * <h2>A palette is a construction, not a list of colours</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link Palette} takes a handful of anchors and derives the rest: surfaces are an even ladder from the page
 * at a fixed lightness step, and text is the ink blended towards the page at a fixed rate. That is the point --
 * every surface in the application stays in step with every other one for free, and a design change is a
 * number here rather than fifteen hex codes spread across the tree.
 *
 * <p>So when a design has fifteen authored colours, the first job is to <b>measure them in Oklab</b> and find
 * out how many decisions they actually are. Usually far fewer, and the ones that do not fit the construction
 * are the interesting ones -- declare those as roles of your own, at their measured values, and note the gap
 * rather than absorbing it. A theme that silently rounds a designer's colour is a theme nobody can check.
 *
 * <p>What is here is a neutral dark starting point, and it is meant to be replaced. The two families are:
 * a cool near-black page with a neutral ink, and one accent. Anything the framework does not name --
 * a rule that has to read against a panel, an accent at its brightest -- goes at the bottom as its own role.

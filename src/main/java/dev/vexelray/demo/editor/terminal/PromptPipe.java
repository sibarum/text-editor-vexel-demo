/**
 * The command line, as something MainFrame can read.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 * MainFrame's forms and confirmations are <em>printed</em>: the shell writes a prompt and reads a line back, the
 * way a terminal has always worked. That suits this window exactly — the question lands in the scrollback and the
 * answer is typed where every other line is typed — but it needs the session's input to be something the window
 * can put a line into, and the session was built on a null reader.
 *
 * <p>So: a queue with a {@link Reader} face. The job thread blocks in {@link #readLine} while a form is asking;
 * the window drops the next typed line in and the block ends. One consumer, one producer, and the queue is the
 * whole of the synchronisation.
 *
 * <h2>Knowing which one a typed line is</h2>
 * A line typed at the prompt is either a new command or an answer to a question, and the difference is not
 * something the window can see in the text. {@link #waiting()} is how it tells: true exactly while the job thread
 * is blocked here, which is exactly while there is a question outstanding. That is a fact about the shell rather
 * than a mode the window has to be put into and taken out of, so the two cannot get out of step — a form that
 * cancels, fails or finishes stops reading, and the next line is a command again with nothing having to say so.
 *
 * <h2>End of input is an answer</h2>
 * {@link #close} makes every present and future read return end-of-stream, which MainFrame already understands:
 * at a confirmation it means no, and in a form it means the person gave up. So shutting the window down while a
 * form is open cancels the form instead of leaving the job thread parked forever.

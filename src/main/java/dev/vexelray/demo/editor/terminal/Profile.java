/**
 * A named set of environment variables and directories to find binaries in — a toolchain, said once and applied
 * whole.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is a form, and why the form is data</h2>
 * A profile is exactly the shape MainFrame's {@link Form} was built for: a couple of scalars and two lists of
 * repeated details. So the editor for one is not a screen anybody had to draw. {@link #definition()} states the
 * fields, and the same statement drives both halves of the job — {@code FormScreen} asks a person for the answers,
 * and {@code Field.problem} judges a record that never went near a keyboard. A variable name that a child process
 * could not receive is refused in both places by the same code, which is the only way the two cannot drift.
 *
 * <h2>Merge, do not replace</h2>
 * {@link #applyTo} sets this profile's variables over whatever the environment already holds and puts its
 * directories at the <em>front</em> of the PATH. Replacing the environment outright would be the more literal
 * reading of "a set of environment variables", and it would break the shell: MainFrame seeds itself from the
 * process, so a replacement would take away PATHEXT, SYSTEMROOT and COMSPEC and leave a session that cannot start
 * a program at all. A profile says what is different about a toolchain, not what an operating system is.
 *
 * @param name  how the profile is listed and referred to
 * @param env   variables to set, in the order they were entered
 * @param paths directories to put on the front of the PATH, first one winning

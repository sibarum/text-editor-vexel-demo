/**
 * The two faces, the type scale, and the gutters.
 *
 * <h2>Type is rem; gutters are dp</h2>
 *
 * <p>That is the framework's rule and it decides what zoom does. {@code rem} grows with the user's zoom because
 * it is proportional to text; {@code dp} does not, because tripling the frame around content you zoomed in to
 * read means seeing less of it. Getting this backwards is not a subtle bug -- it is an application whose zoom
 * makes the window emptier.
 *
 * <h2>The faces are the atlas's, not yours</h2>
 *
 * <p>The framework's text atlas is baked at build time from the fonts in {@code vexelray-text}, so face 0 and
 * face 1 are whatever it shipped -- a sans and a mono. Shadowing it with a design's own typefaces needs the
 * font files and an {@code msdf} plugin run. Worth knowing before a design review, because it is the one part
 * of a look that a screenshot will not match.
